# Retrosprective - Iteraion 2 
After completion iteration 1 we had planned to move what had worked from iteration 1 to iteraion 2.
**What went well?**
* Regular meetings went well.
* Communication was good.

**What went poorly**?
* Work distribution was bit off with too much work assigned to a single person.
* Too much time spent on fixing persistence storage.

**What major actions we took place in iteration 2?**
* Irresolvable bug in implementation of HSQLDB took most of our iteration 2 time. To resolve this we switched to using SQLite as our persistence storage database. As a result of this issue we also ended up pushing few features from iteration 2 to iteration 3. 
**pushed features**
[feature1]()
[feature2]()

**How can we improve in itertion 3?**
* We plan to improve in iteration 3 by having more equal work distribution i.e. dividing work evenly among all members of the group. Big features like implementation of database should have been distributed two or more members instead of one. 
* We will aim to plan more throughly before actual implementation.
